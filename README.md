# Quizzical - music quiz

Solo project from online course "Learn React for free" by Bob Ziroll

Things I've learned with this project:
- Fetching API
- React .setState()
- React .useEffect()
- React syntax
- React components
- Polishing CSS
- Dealing with problems

# Problems

I have came across some problems like:
- Converting answers from API to HTML text without ASCII signs
- Storaging answers and comaring them for results
- Setting up answer element to style when it's correct or wrong (if choosen)
